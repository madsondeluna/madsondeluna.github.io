                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, as a PhD student in Bioinformatics, I'm deepening my expertise in Machine Learning, Genomics, Transcriptomics, Structural Biology and Chemoinformatics. My research applies deep learning algorithms, focusing on generative models to extract biological insights from complex datasets, with the goal of developing an antimicrobial language for generating synthetic compounds inspired by the immune system of diverse organisms. My ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights for the development of new therapeutics against antimicrobial resistance, using scalable in silico methods.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Simultaneously, I'm also a Postgraduate student in Data Science and Analytics, where I'm expanding my expertise in key areas such as data analysis for strategic insights, advanced machine learning, data engineering and governance.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">I hold a Master’s degree in Genetics and Molecular Biology, during which I developed the AMP-Identifier, a machine learning tool designed to identify antimicrobial sequences in genomic data. This tool has shown promising potential in uncovering bioactive compounds in genomes, fostering progress in drug discovery and bioproduct development. Additionally, I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Sciences, with a focus on Bioinformatics and Clinical Pathology. I gained practical experience in hospitals and molecular biology research laboratories and further developed my skills in computational biology working as a bioinformatics intern in research centers.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">In the private sector, I worked as Research and Development Analyst, focusing on the end-to-end development of IoT and AI products. My responsibilities included building roadmaps, defining KPIs, developing MVPs and leading user feedback collection to guide product upgrades. By leveraging data-driven decision-making and applying machine learning to health data, I delivered efficient user-centric solutions. Using Agile, Lean and Scrum approaches, I worked on optimizing team performance and ensuring a well-designed project delivery. Additionally, I conducted market research to identify trends, collaborated with stakeholders to align goals and ensured continuous improvement through agile retrospectives.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Combining skills in research, product management and agile methods, I’m ready to deliver innovative solutions to real-world challenges in general products and especially in life sciences and healthcare, enhancing technology and user experience.</p>
